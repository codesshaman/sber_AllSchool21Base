## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D02_01](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574089/ef93217f-0e43-35c4-bf3f-ef79a3302cb9.png)

In the picture, you can see a Relational Expression in Tree View. This expression corresponds the next SQL query 

    SELECT *
        FROM R CROSS JOIN S
    WHERE clause

So, in other words we can describe any SQL in mathematical terms of Relational Algebra.

The main question (which I hear from my students) is why do we need to learn Relational Algebra in a course, if we can write a SQL in a first attempt? My answer is yes and no in one time. “Yes” means you can write a SQL from the first attempt, that’s right , “No” means you have to know the main aspects of Relational Algebra, because this knowledge is in use for optimization plans and for semantic queries. 
Which type of joins are existing in Relational Algebra?
Actually, “Cross Join” is a primitive operator and it is an anchestor for other types of joins.
- Natural Join
- Theta Join
- Semi Join
- Anti Join
- Left / Right / Full Joins 

But what does a join operation between 2 tables mean? Let me present a part of pseudo code, how join operation works without indexing. 

    FOR r in R LOOP
        FOR s in S LOOP
        if r.id = s.r_id then add(r,s)
        …
        END;
    END;

It’s just a set of loops ... Not magic at all




## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model.

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D03_01](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574090/837fea4c-64f4-3a09-bbaf-8c35fb5813e4.png)

Relation Theory is a mathematical foundation for modern Relational Databases. Every databases’ aspect has corresponding mathematical and logical justification. Including INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE operators. (Dr. Edgar Frank Codd is on the picture).

How the INSERT operator works from a mathematical point of view.

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`INSERT rel RELATION {TUPLE {A INTEGER(4),B INTEGER(4),C STRING ('Hello') }};` | You can use mathematical INSERT statements and integrate “tuple” construction to convert an incoming data to row. |
| From the other side, you can use explicit assignment with the UNION operator. | `rel:=rel UNION RELATION {TUPLE {A INTEGER(4), B INTEGER (7), C STRING ('Hello')}};` |

What’s about the DELETE statement?

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`DELETE rel WHERE A = 1;` | If you want to delete a row for A = 1, you can do it in a direct way. |
| ... or by using a new assignment without key A = 1 | `rel:=rel WHERE NOT (A = 1);` |

... and finally UPDATE statement. Also there are 2 cases.

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`UPDATE rel WHERE A = 1 {B:= 23*A, C:='String #4'};` | Update statement from mathematical point of view |
| New assignment for relation variable rel based on CTE and working with Sets | `rel:=WITH (rel WHERE A = 1) AS T1, (EXTEND T1 ADD (23*A AS NEW_B, 'String #4' AS NEW_C)) AS T2, T2 {ALL BUT B,C} AS T3, (T3 RENAME (NEW _B AS B, NEW _C AS C)) AS T4: (S MINUS T1) UNION T4;` |

The last case with UPDATE statement is really interesting, because in other words you add a new tuple and after that make a MINUS of the old row. The same behavior in physical implementation! Actually, `UPDATE = DELETE + INSERT` and there is a special term “Tombstone” status for a particular deleted/updated row.  Then if you have a lot of Tombstones then you have a bad TPS metric and you need to control your dead data!

Let’s make a cheese of our data! :-)


## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model.

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D04_02](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574092/1f6b0a27-b298-3599-bb2d-86b3533013af.png)

Why do we need virtual tables and materialized views in databases? Databases are just tables, aren't they? 
No, actually not. Databases are similar for object-oriented language. Just recall, you have a lot of abstraction in Java (I mean Java Interfaces). We need abstraction to achieve “Clean Architecture” and change objects with minimal effect on dependencies (sometimes it’s working :-). 

Moreover, there is a specific architectures’ pattern in the Relational Database with the name ANSI/SPARK.
This pattern splits objects on three levels: 
- external level
- conceptual level
- internal level

Therefore we can say that Virtual Tables and Materialized Views are physical interfaces between tables with data and user / application.
So, what is the difference then between 2 objects? The main difference is in the “freshness of data”. Below , you can see behaviors of these objects in graphical representation.

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
| View is a continuous object with the same data like in the underlying table(s), that are used to create this view. Other words, if we select data from view, view reroutes our query to underlying objects and then returns results for us. | ![D04_03](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574092/3d28f4f4-7c45-382c-9ad8-b079abd2617e.png) |
| ![D04_04](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574092/de4a1101-c7ff-32c2-ad58-0cb4c1df672a.png) | Materialized View is a discrete object. Other words, we need to wait when the Materialized View will be refreshed based on an “event trigger” (for example, time schedule). This object always is behind actual data in underlying tables. |

Also, there are “a few” additional differences between View and Materialized View.
- Virtual Table can work with `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` traffic but with some restrictions. 
- Virtual Tables can have “Instead Of” Triggers to make a better control of incoming `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` traffic.
- Materialized View is ReadOnly object for `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` traffic
- Materialized Views can have user defined indexes on columns to speed up queries


## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). **Our knowledge way is incremental and linear therefore please be aware all changes that you made in Day03 during exercises 07-13 should be on place (its similar like in real world , when we applied a release and need to be consistency with data for new changes).**
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model.

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Please write a SQL statement which satisfies a formula `(R - S)∪(S - R)` .
Where R is the `person_visits` table with filter by 2nd of January 2022, S is also `person_visits` table but with a different filter by 6th of January 2022. Please make your calculations with sets under the `person_id` column and this column will be alone in a result. The result please sort by `person_id` column and your final SQL please present in `v_symmetric_union` (*) database view.

(*) to be honest, the definition “symmetric union” doesn’t exist in Set Theory. This is the author's interpretation, the main idea is based on the existing rule of symmetric difference.

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D05_01](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574093/cd18f18e-310d-3efc-926e-a5881d3c8bc2.png)

How does indexing make us faster? Why does the same SQL query with and without index have differences in TPS (Transaction Per Second? Actually, from “user-point-of-view”, index is just a “black box” with magic inside. From “mathematical-point-of-view”, index is just an organized structure and no magic actually. 

Let me explain the reason why the index exists but is not used.

| ------ | ------ |
| Please take a look at the picture, the red line means linear time to find data based on a query. Other words, if you need to find something then you have to see in each block , page , tuple and create a list of your searching rows. (this term has a name “sequential scanning”). Actually, if you created a BTree index, then you got an improvement for speed. So, the green line corresponds to logarithmic searching time. Let’s imagine,  if you have 1000000 rows, and to make a search for 1 row , you need, saying ... 1 second then in total you need 1000000 seconds, but with index you need ln(1000000) ~ 14 seconds | ![D05_02](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574093/8414b894-70c4-3d54-acb3-1c51dec26b51.png) |
| ![D05_03](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574093/32138cd3-c229-33ba-8bd4-212842dc5eff.png) | But why… index is not working? There are different reasons to be honest, but the main one is based on the total number of rows of the indexed table. Please take a look at a picture, I drawed a bold blue line and this is a path for searching algorithms. As you can see, linear time at the beginning is most appropriate for algorithms instead of using logarithmic search. How does one detect this intersection point? Basically I can recommend experiments, benchmarks and … your intuition. No formulas at all. Therefore sometimes, if you want to compare  results of your searching, you need to disable sequential scanning explicitly. For example, there is a special command  set enable_seqscan =off in PostgreSQL |




## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). **Our knowledge way is incremental and linear therefore please be aware all changes that you made in Day03 during exercises 07-13 should be on place (its similar like in real world , when we applied a release and need to be consistency with data for new changes).**
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model.

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

## Exercise 00 - Let’s create indexes for every foreign key

| Exercise 00: Let’s create indexes for every foreign key |                                                                                                                          |

| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |
| Language                        | ANSI SQL                                                                                              |

Please create a simple BTree index for every foreign key in our database. The name pattern should satisfy the next rule “idx_{table_name}_{column_name}”. For example, the name BTree index for the pizzeria_id column in the `menu` table is `idx_menu_pizzeria_id`.

Before further steps please write a SQL statement that returns pizzas’ and corresponding pizzeria names. Please take a look at the sample result below (no sort needed).

| pizza_name | pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | ------ |
| cheese pizza | Pizza Hut |
| ... | ... |

Let’s provide proof that your indexes are working for your SQL.
The sample of proof is the output of the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command. 
Please take a look at the sample output command.
    
    ...
    ->  Index Scan using idx_menu_pizzeria_id on menu m  (...)
    ...

**Hint**: please think why your indexes are not working in a direct way and what should we do to enable it?

Please take a look at SQL below from a technical perspective (ignore a logical case of that SQL statement) .

    SELECT
        m.pizza_name AS pizza_name,
        max(rating) OVER (PARTITION BY rating ORDER BY rating ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS k
    FROM  menu m
    INNER JOIN pizzeria pz ON m.pizzeria_id = pz.id
    ORDER BY 1,2;

Create a new BTree index with name `idx_1` which should improve the “Execution Time” metric of this SQL. Please provide proof (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) that SQL was improved.

**Hint**: this exercise looks like a “brute force” task to find a good covering index therefore before your new test remove `idx_1` index.

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D06_01](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574095/bb4e497c-1fee-3cb5-8a45-8d8054bbe84a.png)

Why is a diamond one of the most durable objects? The reason is in the structure. Every atom knows about his place in diamond’s topology and makes the whole diamond unbreakable. 

Logical structure is like a diamond. If you find an appropriate structure for your own Database Model then you find gold (or diamond :-). There are two aspects of Database Modeling. The first one is a logical view, in other words how your model will smoothly describe the real business world. 

![D06_02](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574095/a35d9657-cfb6-3674-af13-95cdc2fe916d.png)

On the other hand, your model should solve your functional tasks with minimal impaction. It means, logical model view transforms to physical model view and not just from table and attributes descriptions. But actually, from performance and budget perspectives that are more mainly nowadays. How to find a balance? For this case there are 3 steps to create a very good design. Just take a look at the picture below. 

![D06_03](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574095/bd9e8d3a-0a68-32fa-af9f-67372144aae3.png)


## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). **Our knowledge way is incremental and linear therefore please be aware all changes that you made in Day03 during exercises 07-13 and in Day04 during exercise 07 should be on place (its similar like in real world , when we applied a release and need to be consistency with data for new changes).**
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574095/d470a052-6da5-3387-ad0a-52734e254df6.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restaurant (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.


## Chapter IV
## Exercise 00 - Discounts, discounts , everyone loves discounts

Let’s expand our data model to involve a new business feature.
Every person wants to see a personal discount and every business wants to be closer for clients.

Please think about personal discounts for people from one side and pizzeria restaurants from other. Need to create a new relational table (please set a name `person_discounts`) with the next rules.
- set id attribute like a Primary Key (please take a look on id column in existing tables and choose the same data type)
- set for attributes person_id and pizzeria_id foreign keys for corresponding tables (data types should be the same like for id columns in corresponding parent tables)
- please set explicit names for foreign keys constraints by pattern fk_{table_name}_{column_name},  for example `fk_person_discounts_person_id`
- add a discount attribute to store a value of discount in percent. Remember, discount value can be a number with floats (please just use `numeric` data type). So, please choose the corresponding data type to cover this possibility.



## Chapter V
## Exercise 01 - Let’s set personal discounts

| Exercise 01: Let’s set personal discounts|                                                                                                                          |

| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |
| Language                        | SQL, DML, DDL                                                                                              |

Actually, we created a structure to store our discounts and we are ready to go further and fill our `person_discounts` table with new records.

So, there is a table `person_order` that stores the history of a person's orders. Please write a DML statement (`INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...`) that makes  inserts new records into `person_discounts` table based on the next rules.
- take aggregated state by person_id and pizzeria_id columns 
- calculate personal discount value by the next pseudo code:

    `if “amount of orders” = 1 then
        “discount” = 10.5 
    else if “amount of orders” = 2 then 
        “discount” = 22
    else 
        “discount” = 30`

- to generate a primary key for the person_discounts table please use  SQL construction below (this construction is from the WINDOW FUNCTION  SQL area).
    
    `... ROW_NUMBER( ) OVER ( ) AS id ...`




## Chapter VI
## Exercise 02 - Let’s recalculate a history of orders

| Exercise 02: Let’s recalculate a history of orders|                                                                                                                          |

| Files to turn-in                      | `day06_ex02.sql`                                                                                 |
| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |

Please write a SQL statement that returns orders with actual price and price with applied discount for each person in the corresponding pizzeria restaurant and sort by person name, and pizza name. Please take a look at the sample of data below.

| name | pizza_name | price | discount_price | pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Andrey | cheese pizza | 800 | 624 | Dominos |
| Andrey | mushroom pizza | 1100 | 858 | Dominos |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Actually, we have to make improvements to data consistency from one side and performance tuning from the other side. Please create a multicolumn unique index (with name `idx_person_discounts_unique`) that prevents duplicates of pair values person and pizzeria identifiers.

After creation of a new index, please provide any simple SQL statement that shows proof of index usage (by using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`).
The example of “proof” is below
    
    ...
    Index Scan using idx_person_discounts_unique on person_discounts
    ...

Please add the following constraint rules for existing columns of the `person_discounts` table.
- person_id column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_person_id`)
- pizzeria_id column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_pizzeria_id`)
- discount column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_discount`)
- discount column should be 0 percent by default
- discount column should be in a range values from 0 to 100 (use constraint name `ch_range_discount`)

To satisfy Data Governance Policies need to add comments for the table and table's columns. Let’s apply this policy for the `person_discounts` table. Please add English or Russian comments (it's up to you) that explain what is a business goal of a table and all included attributes.

Let’s create a Database Sequence with the name `seq_person_discounts` (starting from 1 value) and set a default value for id attribute of `person_discounts` table to take a value from `seq_person_discounts` each time automatically. 
Please be aware that your next sequence number is 1, in this case please set an actual value for database sequence based on formula “amount of rows in person_discounts table” + 1. Otherwise you will get errors about Primary Key violation constraint.

## Preamble

![D01_01](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574086/b79b3c29-8234-31a2-8855-f1470a802fab.png)

Standards are everywhere, and Relational Databases are under control as well :-). To be honest between us, more restricted SQL standards were at the beginning of 2000 years. Actually when the “Big Data” pattern was born, Relational Databases had their own way to realize this pattern and therefore standards right now are more ... lightweight. 

![D01_02](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574086/480ee6b5-8bae-3ca5-baf9-7b2a65aea548.png)

Please take a look at some SQL standards below and try to think about the future of Relational Databases.

## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model.

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D01_01](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574087/c5ad3fc5-483b-37e3-a8a3-3fb747406563.png)

In many aspects, sets are used in Relational Databases. Not just, make UNION or find MINUS between sets. Sets are also good candidates to make recursive queries.

There are the next set operators in PostgreSQL. 
- UNION [ALL]
- EXCEPT [ALL] 
- INTERSECT [ALL]

Keyword “ALL” means to save duplicates of rows in the result.
The main rules to work with sets are below
- The main SQL provides a final names of attributes for whole query
- The attributes of controlled SQL should satisfied number of columns and corresponding family types of main SQL

![D01_02](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574087/8d5417b4-f269-3f1f-bb78-c6018125e5d7.png)

Moreover, SQL sets are useful  to calculate some specific Data Science metrics, for example Jaccard distance between 2 objects based on existing data features.


## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model.

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D08_01](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574106/c2f0a846-2b20-3523-b47c-3f9d81bda8b0.png)

The Penrose stairs or Penrose steps, also dubbed the impossible staircase, is an impossible object created by Lionel Penrose and his son Roger Penrose. A variation on the Penrose triangle, it is a two-dimensional depiction of a staircase in which the stairs make four 90-degree turns as they ascend or descend yet form a continuous loop, so that a person could climb them forever and never get any higher. This is clearly impossible in three dimensions. The \"continuous staircase\" was first presented in an article that the Penroses wrote in 1959, based on the so-called \"triangle of Penrose\" published by Roger Penrose in the British Journal of Psychology in 1958. 

“Penrose Stairs” is a mathematical anomaly, actually Database Theory has 4 foundametal data anomalies (physical anomalies).
- Lost Update Anomaly
- Dirty Reads Anomaly
- Non-repeatable Reads Anomaly
- Phantom Read Anomaly

Therefore there are different Isolation Levels in ANSI SQL standard that prevent famous anomalies.

Nowadays, IT community found a set of new anomalies based on Database Model (logical view)
- Read Skew Anomaly
- Write Skew Anomaly
- Serialization Anomaly
- Fan Traps Anomaly
- Chasm Traps Anomaly 
- Data Model Loops Anomaly
- etc.


## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). **Our knowledge way is incremental and linear therefore please be aware all changes that you made in Day03 during exercises 07-13 and in Day04 during exercise 07 should be on place (its similar like in real world , when we applied a release and need to be consistency with data for new changes).**
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model.

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

## Exercise 00 - Simple transaction

| Exercise 00: Simple transaction |                                                                                                                          |

Please for this task use the command line for PostgreSQL database (psql). You need to check how your changes will be published in the database for other database users. 

Actually, we need two active sessions (meaning 2 parallel sessions in the command lines). 

Please provide a proof that your parallel session can’t see your changes until you will make a `COMMIT`;

Take a look at the steps below.

**Session #1**
- update of rating for “Pizza Hut” to 5 points in a transaction mode .
- check that you can see a changes in session #1

**Session #2**
- check that you can’t see a changes in session #2

**Session #1**
- publish your changes for all parallel sessions.

**Session #2**
- check that you can see a changes in session #2


So, take a look on example of my output for Session #2.

    pizza_db=> select * from pizzeria where name  = 'Pizza Hut';
    id |   name    | rating
    ----+-----------+--------
    1 | Pizza Hut |    4.6
    (1 row)

    pizza_db=> select * from pizzeria where name  = 'Pizza Hut';
    id |   name    | rating
    ----+-----------+--------
    1 | Pizza Hut |      5
    (1 row)

You can see the same query returns different results, because the first one was run before publishing in Session#1 and the second one was queried after finished Session#1.

Please for this task use the command line for PostgreSQL database (psql). You need to check how your changes will be published in the database for other database users. 

Actually, we need two active sessions (meaning 2 parallel sessions in the command lines). 

Before a task, make sure you are at a default isolation level in your database. Just run the next statement

`SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL;`

and the result should be “read committed”;

If not, then please set “read committed” isolation level explicitly on a session level.

| Let’s check one of the famous “Lost Update Anomaly” database pattern. You can see a graphical presentation of that anomaly on a picture. Horizontal Red Line means the final results after all sequential steps for both Sessions. | ![D08_06](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574106/a0dbe9c6-fb58-34ff-b8f0-06dc3742a8e1.png) |

Please check a rating for “Pizza Hut” in a transaction mode for both Sessions and after that make `UPDATE` of rating to 4 value in session #1 and make `UPDATE` of rating to 3.6 value in session #2 (in the same order as in the picture).

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D09_01](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574108/cf03ac34-1445-3840-b63c-a5b56d8399c6.png)

There are a lot of functional programming languages in the RDBMS world. We can say mainly about “one-to-one” dependency between a particular RDBMS engine and functional language inside. Please take a look at a sample of these languages.
- T-SQL
- PL/SQL
- SQL
- PL/PGSQL
- PL/R
- PL/Python
- etc.

Actually, there are two opposite opinions in the IT world about where business logic should be located. The first opinion is on Application Level, the second one in RDBMS directly based on set UDF (User Defined Functions / Procedures / Packages). 
Everyone chooses their own way to implement business logic. From my point of view, business logic should be in both places and I can say why.  
Please take a look at the 2 simple architectures below. 

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
| ![D09_02](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574108/38917ffa-a5f4-31bb-ae03-0fcdb2d3d112.png) | Everything is clear, frontends and backends are working through a special REST API layer that implements whole business logic. That's a really ideal application world. |
| But, there are always some privileged guys / applications (like IDE) that are working directly with our databases and … our pattern can be broken. | ![D09_03](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574108/ff195475-c061-3693-aafc-349695c23c94.png) |

Just think about it and try to create a clean architecture :-)


## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). **Our knowledge way is incremental and linear therefore please be aware all changes that you made in Day03 during exercises 07-13 and in Day04 during exercise 07 should be on place (its similar like in real world , when we applied a release and need to be consistency with data for new changes).**
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574108/579878a0-ae11-3eb1-85f9-c6bdc689045b.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application.

We want to be stronger with data and don’t want to lose any event of changes. Let’s implement an audit feature for INSERT’s incoming changes. 
Please create a table `person_audit` with the same structure like a person table but please add a few additional changes. Take a look at the table below with descriptions for each column.

| Column | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| created | timestamp with time zone | timestamp when a new event has been created.  Default value is a current timestamp and NOT NULL |
| type_event | char(1) | possible values I (insert), D (delete), U (update). Default value is ‘I’. NOT NULL. Add check constraint `ch_type_event` with possible values ‘I’, ‘U’ and ‘D’ |
| row_id |bigint | copy of person.id. NOT NULL |
| name |varchar | copy of person.name (no any constraints) |
| age |integer | copy of person.age (no any constraints) |
| gender |varchar | copy of person.gender (no any constraints) |
| address |varchar | copy of person.address (no any constraints) |

Actually, let’s create a Database Trigger Function with the name `fnc_trg_person_insert_audit` that should process `INSERT` DML traffic and make a copy of a new row to the person_audit table.

Just a hint, if you want to implement a PostgreSQL trigger (please read it in PostgreSQL documentation), you need to make 2 objects: Database Trigger Function and Database Trigger. 

So, please define a Database Trigger with the name `trg_person_insert_audit` with the next options
- trigger with “FOR EACH ROW” option
- trigger with “AFTER INSERT”
- trigger calls fnc_trg_person_insert_audit trigger function

When you are ready with trigger objects then please make an `INSERT` statement into the person table. 
`INSERT INTO person(id, name, age, gender, address) VALUES (10,'Damir', 22, 'male', 'Irkutsk');`

Let’s continue to implement our audit pattern for the person table. Just define a trigger `trg_person_update_audit` and corresponding trigger function `fnc_trg_person_update_audit` to handle all `UPDATE` traffic on the person table. We should save OLD states of all attribute’s values.

When you are ready please apply UPDATE’s statements below.

`UPDATE person SET name = 'Bulat' WHERE id = 10;`
`UPDATE person SET name = 'Damir' WHERE id = 10;`

Finally, we need to handle `DELETE` statements and make a copy of OLD states for all attribute’s values. Please create a trigger `trg_person_delete_audit` and corresponding trigger function `fnc_trg_person_delete_audit`. 

When you are ready please apply the SQL statement below.

`DELETE FROM person WHERE id = 10;`

Actually, there are 3 triggers for one `person` table. Let’s merge all our logic to the one main trigger with the name `trg_person_audit` and a new corresponding trigger function `fnc_trg_person_audit`.

Other words, all DML traffic (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) should be handled from the one functional block. Please explicitly define a separated IF-ELSE block for every event (I, U, D)!

Additionally, please take the steps below .
- to drop 3 old triggers from the person table.
- to drop 3 old trigger functions
- to make a `TRUNCATE` (or `DELETE`) of all rows in our `person_audit` table

When you are ready, please re-apply the set of DML statements.
`INSERT INTO person(id, name, age, gender, address)  VALUES (10,'Damir', 22, 'male', 'Irkutsk');`
`UPDATE person SET name = 'Bulat' WHERE id = 10;`
`UPDATE person SET name = 'Damir' WHERE id = 10;`
`DELETE FROM person WHERE id = 10;`

As you remember, we created 2 database views to separate data from the person tables by gender attribute. 
Please define 2 SQL-functions (please be aware, not pl/pgsql-functions) with names
- `fnc_persons_female` (should return female persons)
- `fnc_persons_male` (should return male persons)

To check yourself and call a function, you can make a statement like below (amazing! you can work with a function like with a virtual table!). 

    SELECT *
    FROM fnc_persons_male();

    SELECT *
    FROM fnc_persons_female();

Looks like 2 functions from exercise 04 need a more generic approach. Please before our further steps drop these functions from the database. 
Write a common SQL-function (please be aware, not pl/pgsql-function) with the name `fnc_persons`. This function should have an `IN` parameter pgender with default value = ‘female’. 

To check yourself and call a function, you can make a statement like below (wow! you can work with a function like with a virtual table but with more flexibilities!). 

    select *
    from fnc_persons(pgender := 'male');

    select *

Let’s look at pl/pgsql functions right now. 

Please create a pl/pgsql function  `fnc_person_visits_and_eats_on_date` based on SQL statement that finds the names of pizzerias which person (`IN` pperson parameter with default value is ‘Dmitriy’) visited and bought pizza for less than the given sum in rubles (`IN` pprice parameter with default value is 500) on the specific date (`IN` pdate parameter with default value is 8th of January 2022). 

To check yourself and call a function, you can make a statement like below.

    select *
    from fnc_person_visits_and_eats_on_date(pprice := 800);

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![T00_01](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=gitlab/content_versions/574110/7f3c9bb9-af14-336a-9139-c0c23158f69b.png)

Given a finite number of \"cities\" along with the cost of travel between each pair of them, find the cheapest way of visiting all the cities and returning to your starting point. (on image Proctor and Gamble company ran a contest in 1962.  The contest required solving a TSP on a specified 33 cities.  There was a tie between many people who found the optimum.  An early TSP researcher, Professor Gerald Thompson of Carnegie Mellon University, was one of the winners.)

The travel costs are symmetric in the sense that traveling from city X to city Y costs just as much as traveling from Y to X; the \"way of visiting all the cities\" is simply the order in which the cities are visited. To put it differently, the data consist of integer weights assigned to the edges of a finite complete graph; the objective is to find a hamiltonian cycle (that is, a cycle passing through all the vertices) of the minimum total weight.  In this context, hamiltonian cycles are commonly called tours.

The origins of the TSP are obscure. In the 1920's, the mathematician and economist Karl Menger publicized it among his colleagues in Vienna. In the 1930's, the problem reappeared in the mathematical circles of Princeton. In the 1940's, it was  studied by statisticians (Mahalanobis (1940), Jessen (1942), Gosh (1948), Marks (1948)) in connection with an agricultural  application and the mathematician Merill Flood popularized it among his colleagues at the RAND Corporation.  Eventually,  the TSP gained notoriety as the prototype of a hard problem in combinatorial optimization: examining the tours one by one  is out of the question because of their large number, and no other idea was on the horizon for a long time.

Please take a look at the Graph on the left. 
There are 4 cities (a, b, c and d) and arcs between them with cost (or taxination). Actually the cost (a,b) = (b,a).

Please create a table with name nodes by using structure {point1, point2, cost} and fill data based on a picture (remember there are direct and reverse paths between 2 nodes).
Please write one SQL statement that returns all tours (aka paths) with minimal traveling cost if we will start from city \"a\".
Just remember, you need to find the cheapest way of visiting all the cities and returning to your starting point. For example, the tour looks like that a -> b -> c -> d -> a.

The sample of output data you can find below. Please sort data by total_cost and then by tour.

| total_cost | tour |
| ------ | ------ |
| 80 | {a,b,d,c,a} |
| ... | ... |

## Preamble

![D07_01](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574096/8d2e9c07-b2be-3063-83b8-0fd926d89c8d.png)

Please take a look at Curve of Usefulness for detailed data in time. Other words, detailed data (means user transactions, facts about products and providers, etc.) are not useful for us from a historical perspective, because we just need to know  some aggregation to describe what was going on a year ago.

Why does it happen? The reason is in our analytical mind. Actually we want to concentrate on our business strategy from a historical perspective to set new business goals and we don’t need details. 

From a database point of view, “Analytical mind” corresponds to OLAP  traffic (information layer), “details” corresponds to OLTP traffic (raw data layer). Today there is a more flexible pattern to store detailed data and aggregated information in the ecosystem. I am talking about `LakeHouse = DataLake + DataWareHouse`.

If we are talking about historical data then we should mention the “Data lifecycle management” pattern. Simple words, what should we do with old data? TTL (time-to-live), SLA for data, Retention Data Policy, etc. are terms that are in use in Data Governance strategy.

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restaurant (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Please write a SQL statement to see restaurants are grouping by visits and by orders and joined with each other by using restaurant name.  
You can use internal SQLs from Exercise 02 (restaurants by visits and by orders) without limitations of amount of rows.

Additionally, please add the next rules.
- calculate a sum of orders and visits for corresponding pizzeria (be aware, not all pizzeria keys are presented in both tables).
- sort results by `total_count` column in descending mode and by `name` in ascending mode.
Take a look at the data sample below.

| name | total_count |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dominos | 13 |
| DinoPizza | 9 |
| ... | ... |

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![T01_01](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574112/542ba91b-7ef8-316e-b463-11326b4dbc46.png)

A Data Warehousing (DWH) is a process for collecting and managing data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights. A Data warehouse is typically used to connect and analyze business data from heterogeneous sources. The data warehouse is the core of the BI system which is built for data analysis and reporting.

There are 2 DWH- “fathers” with opposite opinions on how to make a better DWH from logical data layers.

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
| “A DWH is a subject-oriented, integrated, nonvolatile, and time-variant collection of data in support of management’s decisions” (Bill Inmon) | ![T01_02](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574112/29189ddc-9e94-350f-b701-4cd3e219fa0d.png) |
| ![T01_03](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574112/03cb2805-c5b7-39d7-b246-4aca7cd93927.png) | “A DWH is a system that extracts, cleans, conforms, and delivers source data into a dimensional data store and then supports and implements querying and analysis for the purpose of decision making” (Ralph Kimball) |

Nowadays, Big Data is coming more and more and we need more resources to control, structure and further research our data. To support classical DataWareHouse systems there is a new pattern called LakeHouse (based on λ-architecture) = DataLake + DataWareHouse. From a logical point of view, we can imagine a modern LakeHouse like a set of logical data layers.

![T01_04](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574112/ddc73126-973a-3fb0-82cc-9b9fec388194.png)

Therefore, to be a Data Architect you need to know a “bit more” than Relational Modeling. 
I would like to show a list of existing Data Models Patterns. 
- Relational Model
- Temporal Model
- BiTemporal Model
- USS Model
- EAV Model
- Star / Snowflake Models
- Galaxy Model
- Data Vault Model
- Anchor Model
- Graph Model


## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please download a [script](materials/rush01_model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model.

Let’s take a look at the data sources and first logical data layer (ODS - Operational Data Store) in the DWH.

![T01_05](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574112/44a16f33-e9bc-376f-9f68-02525a688893.png)

`User` table Definition (in a Green Source Database):

| Column Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| ID | Primary Key |
| name | Name of User |
| lastname | Last name of User |

`Currency` table Definition (in a Red Source Database):

| Column Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| ID | Primary Key |
| name | Currency Name |
| rate_to_usd | Ratio to USD currency |

`Balance` table Definition (in a Blue Source Database):

| Column Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| user_id | “Virtual Foreign Key” to User table from other source |
| money | Amount of money |
| type | Type of balance (can be 0,1,...) |
| currency_id | “Virtual Foreign Key” to Currency table from other source |

Green, Red and Blue databases are independent data sources and satisfy the pattern of microservice. It means, there is a high risk of data anomalies (presented below).
- Tables are not in data consistency. It means there is a User, but does not have any rows in the Balance table, or vice versa, there is a Balance , but no rows in the User table. The same situation between Currency and Balance tables. (other words, doesn’t exist explicit Foreign Keys between them)
- Possible NULL values for name and lastname in User table
- All tables are working under OLTP (OnLine Transactional Processing) SQL traffic. It means there is an actual state of data at one time, historical changes are not saved for every table.

These 3 listed tables are data sources for the tables with the similar data models in the DWH area.

`User` table Definition (in a DWH Database):

| Column Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| ID | Primary Key |
| name | Name of User |
| lastname | Last name of User |

`Currency` table Definition (in a DWH Database):

| Column Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| ID | Mocked Primary Key |
| name | Currency Name |
| rate_to_usd | Ratio to USD currency |
| updated | Timestamp of event from source database |

`Mocked Primary Key`  means there are duplicates with the same ID, because a new updated attribute was added that transforms our Relational Model to Temporal Relational Model. 

Please take a look at the Data Sample for “EUR” currency below.
This sample is based on SQL statement

    SELECT *
    FROM Currency
    WHERE name = ‘EUR’
    ORDER BY updated DESC;

| ID | name | rate_to_usd | updated |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 100 | EUR | 0.9 | 03.03.2022 13:31 |
| 100 | EUR | 0.89 | 02.03.2022 12:31 |
| 100 | EUR | 0.87 | 02.03.2022 08:00 |
| 100 | EUR | 0.9 | 01.03.2022 15:36 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

`Balance` table Definition (in a DWH Database):

| Column Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| user_id | “Virtual Foreign Key” to User table from other source |
| money | Amount of money |
| type | Type of balance (can be 0,1,...) |
| currency_id | “Virtual Foreign Key” to Currency table from other source |
| updated | Timestamp of event from source database |

Please take a look at the Data Sample below.
This sample is based on SQL statement

    SELECT *
    FROM Balance
    WHERE user_id = 103
    ORDER BY type, updated DESC;

| user_id | money | type | currency_id | updated |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 103 | 200 | 0 | 100 | 03.03.2022 12:31 |
| 103 | 150 | 0 | 100 | 02.03.2022 11:29 |
| 103 | 15 | 0 | 100 | 03.03.2022 08:00 |
| 103 | -100 | 1 | 102 | 01.03.2022 15:36 |
| 103 | 2000 | 1 | 102 | 12.12.2021 15:36 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |... |

All tables in DWH inherit all anomalies from source tables as well.
- Tables are not in data consistency. 
- Possible NULL values for name and lastname in User table

Please write a SQL statement that returns the total volume (sum of all money) of transactions from user balance aggregated by user and balance type. Please be aware, all data should be processed including data with anomalies. Below presented a table of result columns and corresponding calculation formula.

| Output Column | Formula (pseudocode) |
| ------ | ------ |
| name | source: user.name if user.name is NULL then return `not defined` value |
| lastname | source: user.lastname if user.lastname is NULL then return `not defined` value |
| type | source: balance.type | 
| volume | source: balance.money need to summarize all money “movements” | 
| currency_name | source: currency.name if currency.name is NULL then return `not defined` value | 
| last_rate_to_usd | source: currency.rate_to_usd. take a last currency.rate_to_usd for corresponding currency if currency.rate_to_usd is NULL then return 1 | 
| total_volume_in_usd | source: volume , last_rate_to_usd. make a multiplication between volume and last_rate_to_usd |

Please take a look at a sample of output data below. Sort the result by user name in descending mode and then by user lastname and balance type in ascending mode.

| name | lastname | type | volume | currency_name | last_rate_to_usd | total_volume_in_usd |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Петр | not defined | 2 | 203 | not defined | 1 | 203 |
| Иван | Иванов | 1 | 410 | EUR | 0.9 | 369 |

| Language                        | ANSI SQL|


Before deeper diving into this task please apply INSERTs statements below.

`insert into currency values (100, 'EUR', 0.85, '2022-01-01 13:29');`
`insert into currency values (100, 'EUR', 0.79, '2022-01-08 13:29');`

Please write a SQL statement that returns all Users , all Balance transactions (in this task please ignore currencies that do not have a key in the `Currency` table ) with currency name and calculated value of currency in USD for the nearest day.

Below presented a table of result columns and corresponding calculation formula.

| Output Column | Formula (pseudocode) |
| ------ | ------ |
| name | source: user.name if user.name is NULL then return `not defined` value |
| lastname | source: user.lastname if user.lastname is NULL then return `not defined` value |
| currency_name | source: currency.name | 
| currency_in_usd | involved sources: currency.rate_to_usd, currency.updated, balance.updated.Take a look at a graphical interpretation of the formula below.| 

![T01_06](https://edu.21-school.ru/services/storage/download/public_any/182e845c-6712-4356-814d-7295dc8afe30?path=tenantId/96098f4b-5708-4c42-a62c-6893419169b3/gitlab/content_versions/574112/75d3374e-e2a2-3aa3-bdc6-5aef2189fca7.png)

- need to find a nearest rate_to_usd of currency at the past (t1) 
- if t1 is empty (means no any rates at the past) then find a nearest rate_to_usd of currency at the future (t2)
- use t1 OR t2 rate to calculate a currency in USD format

Please take a look at a sample of output data below. Sort the result by user name in descending mode and then by user lastname and currency name in ascending mode.

| name | lastname | currency_name | currency_in_usd |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Иван | Иванов | EUR | 150.1 |
| Иван | Иванов | EUR | 17 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
